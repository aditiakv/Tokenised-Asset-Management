# Tokenised-Asset-Management
This project focuses on managing tokenized assets on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes a simple user interface that allows users to interact with Ethereum smart contracts for token balance checks and token transfers. Using Web3.js, the application connects to either MetaMask or a local Ethereum network (such as Ganache) to execute transactions.
Key features of the project include:
Check Balance: Displays the balance of Ether (ETH) in the connected wallet.
Transfer Tokens: Allows users to send ETH from one address to another by entering the recipient's address and the amount to transfer.
The application is designed for educational and testing purposes, showcasing how blockchain technology can be used for decentralized asset management.
